This project uses Naive Bayes Algorithm for Text Classification problem.

It uses different solutions (Naive Bayes, Random Prediction, Majority Prediction) for cost function optimization.
Removes STOP WORDS, performs STEMMING and does feature selection (BI-GRAMS, TRI-GRAMS) to estimate the best value of the model parameters.

It also draws Confusion Matrix.
